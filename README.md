# Lilliputain
<h2>About</h2>
Lilliputain is an interpreted assembly language that is written in C++. While it is not a true assembly language, it mimics the behavior of actual assemblies. The name "Lilliputain" comes from the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. The word lilliputian has become an adjective meaning "very small in size", which is fitting to this assembly language as it was not meant to have the full capabillities of an x86 or NASM assembler.
